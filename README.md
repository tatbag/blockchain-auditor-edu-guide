## Introduction
In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology, smart contracts have become the backbone of decentralized applications, facilitating secure and transparent transactions. However, their complexity can also make them susceptible to vulnerabilities and risks.

To ensure the robustness of smart contracts and protect user funds, the role of smart contract auditors has grown in significance. These skilled professionals possess a unique blend of blockchain knowledge, programming skills, and security expertise, enabling them to identify and address potential weaknesses in smart contract code.

This document serves as a comprehensive self-education roadmap for aspiring smart contract auditors. It outlines essential topics, valuable resources, and practical exercises to empower auditors in conducting thorough and effective smart contract audits. Whether you're a blockchain enthusiast, a bored-of-development engineer like me, or a security specialist seeking to specialize in smart contract auditing, this roadmap will help you gain the skills needed to kickstart your career in the field. Follow this guide and happy hacking!

**P.S:** This guide is for people who are already familiar with many computer science topics and are proficient in coding, architecture design, deeply understand networking, TCP/IP concepts, and are at least familiar with information security discipline (protocols, cryptography basics, penetration testing, OWASP). If you feel you're missing something from the list, it would be more efficient if you spend some time understanding the basic topics, then come back.

**P.P.S:** It would be even more efficient if you gain some knowledge in traditional finances. It would help you understand Defi protocols better and to pentest them more effectively.

## Blockchain Fundamentals
These are some useful books I've read to understand the topic, blockchain economy, and blockchain architecture from a technical point of view.
